Graph-based temporal data analysis has emerged as a critical tool for detecting fraud and anomalies in large-scale transaction networks. However, existing graph-based fraud detection methods face significant challenges, including ineffective capture of temporal dependencies, inability to handle incomplete or missing information, and poor scalability for analyzing evolving network structures in adversarial environments.
To address these limitations, we propose Multi-GAT LSTM (MG-LSTM), a novel temporal graph neural network that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with an enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. MG-LSTM introduces a multi-graph attention mechanism to control the gating process of the LSTM, enabling the model to effectively capture both short-term and long-term dependencies. This architecture is specifically designed for adversarial robust temporal graph learning of fraud detection, offering improved capability in modeling complex temporal and structural patterns.
Our approach incorporates a missing information prediction module that significantly improves detection performance in real-world scenarios where adversaries deliberately obfuscate transaction patterns.
We evaluate MG-LSTM on several real-world financial transaction datasets, demonstrating superior performance in fraud detection with an average improvement of 14.7% in AUC, 16.2% in precision, and 18.9% in recall compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our security analysis demonstrates that MG-LSTM maintains robust performance even under sophisticated evasion attacks designed to manipulate temporal patterns. The model's ability to predict missing information and adapt to evolving adversarial behaviors makes it particularly suitable for deployment in critical financial security applications where attackers actively attempt to circumvent detection systems.
